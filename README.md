# Future Features (todo/bugs)
### main
Create interface (or interact with IRC) so its not cli based

### recommend
None of this functions it's literally a shell

### scorepost
askInput - robust user input (misinputs + player has no scores on that gamemode)
If the score was modded, the star rating doesn't change it shows it NM
Add an if fc to recent play (must check that it wasn't an fc first)

### general
Currently good!
